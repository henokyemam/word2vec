The Word2Vec algorithm learns distributed representations of words from large text corpora.
    Skip-gram architecture predicts context words given a center word in a sliding window.
    CBOW architecture predicts the center word given surrounding context words.
    Negative sampling improves training efficiency by sampling negative examples.
    Subsampling of frequent words helps balance the training data distribution.
    The model captures semantic and syntactic relationships between words effectively.
    Similar words appear close together in the learned embedding space.
    These word embeddings are useful for many natural language processing tasks.
    The training process involves optimizing embeddings through gradient descent.
    Each sliding window over text generates multiple positive training examples.
    The neural network learns to distinguish positive pairs from negative pairs.
    Word vectors encode rich linguistic information in dense vector representations.
    Machine learning models can use these embeddings as input features.
    The algorithm was introduced by Mikolov and colleagues at Google.
    Word embeddings have revolutionized natural language processing applications.
    Deep learning models benefit significantly from pre-trained word representations.
    The continuous bag of words model averages context word embeddings.
    Skip-gram tends to work better with infrequent words and small datasets.
    Hierarchical softmax is an alternative to negative sampling for training.
    The quality of embeddings depends on the size and diversity of training corpus.
    Word2Vec inspired many subsequent embedding methods like GloVe and FastText.
    Contextual embeddings from transformers have largely superseded static embeddings.
    However Word2Vec remains important for understanding embedding fundamentals.
